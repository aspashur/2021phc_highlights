<h3 id="markdown">PREFACE</h3>

<p align="justify">The Ghana 2021 Population and Housing Census (PHC) was conducted to provide updated demographic, social and economic data for research, policy and planning to support national development activities and to track the implementation of national, continental, and global development goals, such as The Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies (2017-2024); An Agenda for Jobs: Creating Prosperity and Equal Opportunity for All; AU Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want; and Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.<BR><BR>
As Ghana’s first fully digital census, the 2021 PHC presents the country and the global community with timely data within three months of exiting the field. The report highlights the resourcefulness of the census, which is the only national data collection exercise that can provide the lowest levels of disaggregation to support decentralised decision making across the nation. The General Report, the third major census product release, presents the main results in eleven volumes, with each volume focusing on a different module of the 2021 PHC questionnaire. <BR><BR>
This report compiles highlights of results across all the volumes: Population of Regions and Districts; Age and Sex Profile; Background Characteristics; Literacy and Education; Economic Activity; Difficulty in Performing Activities; Information and Communication Technology; Fertility and Mortality; Housing Characteristics; Water and Sanitation; and Structures. <BR><BR>
The compilation is intended for readers needing a broader reflection on all the highlights from the 2021 PHC. The aim is to foster a collaborative and intersectoral approach in the development of planning targets and design policies of Government Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs), development partners, civil society organisations (CSOs), private sector, researchers, and the public. The disaggregated statistics particularly, will support the identification of vulnerable groups for the development and delivery of targeted interventions.

Proportion of the population that is urban varies across the regions with the highest in Greater Accra Region (91.7%) and lowest in Upper East Region (25.4%).<br><br>
Seven regions are urbanised. That is, more than half of the population in those regions live in urban areas.
